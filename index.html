        <p>The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/" target="_blank">Softcover</a> publishing platfor was designed mainly for ebooks like some popular IT textbooks but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby-Dick</em> ). We present below a short and effectionately orreverent book report on this classic of American Literature</p>

    <h3>Moby-Dick: A classic tale of the sea</h3>
        <a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank"><img src="images/moby_dick.png" alt="Moby Dick" style="height: 200px; float: left;"></a>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moby-Dick</a></em> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:</p>
        <blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px">call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having litter or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I though I would sail about a litter and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.</blockquote>
        <p>after driving off his spleen (which <i>can't</i>be good for you),Ismael the goes on in much the same vein for approximately one jillion pages. The only this better that Moby Dick (who <i>-spoiler alert-</i> is a giant white whale) is the book itself </p>
